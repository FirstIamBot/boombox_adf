# WiFi Manager - Web UI Example

Example demonstrating WiFi Manager with embedded Web UI.

## Features

- Modern responsive Web UI
- Dark mode support (auto-detect)
- Captive portal for initial setup
- mDNS for easy access (esp32-xxx.local)
- Embedded files (~10KB gzipped)

## Build & Flash

**Note**: Web UI is pre-built and embedded in the component. Just enable it in config.

```bash
cd examples/with_webui
idf.py build flash monitor
```

If you want to modify the frontend, see `with_webui_customize` example.

## Usage

### First Setup (No Saved Networks)

1. Device starts in AP mode: `ESP32-Setup-XXXXXX`
2. Connect to this WiFi network (open, no password)
3. Captive portal opens automatically, or go to `http://192.168.4.1/`
4. Use Web UI to scan and connect to your WiFi

### After Connection

Access the Web UI at:
- `http://<device-ip>/` (shown in serial monitor)
- `http://esp32-xxxxxx.local/` (mDNS, if supported)
